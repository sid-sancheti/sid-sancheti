Nice to meet you! My name is Sid Sancheti.

I am a third-year Computer Science student at Purdue University. I am pursuing a concentration in Security and Machine Intelligence with a minor in Mathematics. I have a wide array of interest ranging from computer graphics to full-stack dev to low-level programming.
